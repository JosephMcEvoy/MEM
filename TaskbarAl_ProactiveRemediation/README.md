Remediation script to set the Taskbar alignment to the left. 
The remediation only checks for the existence of the TaskbarAl property since this does not exist unless and until the taskbar alignment has been set to the left. This also means that if the user prefers the alignment centered and sets the Taskbar alignment back, it will stay centered.
