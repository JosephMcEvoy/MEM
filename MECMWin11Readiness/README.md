In order to help you prepare for your journey to Windows 11, weâ€™ve developed a process that adds devices to a device collection based on the returned results of a PowerShell script deployed to clients. The PowerShell script is a slightly modified version of the HardwareReadiness.ps1 script that was shared on the MEM blog. It uses .NET API to retrieve details about hardware on the device and whether they meet the hardware requirements in place for Windows 11. 

The Word doc has all the details on how to use the files to replicate this to your environment.
